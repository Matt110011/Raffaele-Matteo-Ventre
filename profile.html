               "I'm a 22-year-old Italian currently in my final year at Nottingham Trent University. While I've played a variety of sports in the past, these days I spend most of my time at the gym, hitting it five times a week. Recently, I've also started practicing kickboxing and have been enjoying the challenge it presents. When I'm not working out or studying, you can usually find me trying out new recipes in the kitchen or listening to podcasts."

                <br>
                As an international student, studying International Business at Nottingham Trent University has been a fantastic opportunity for me to learn about the global economy and how businesses operate in different parts of the world. The course has challenged me to think critically about complex issues such as global trade, economic policy, and cultural differences in business practices. Through a combination of lectures, seminars, and practical projects, I've developed skills such as data analysis, problem-solving, and intercultural communication that will be invaluable as I move forward in my career.  <br>
                I feel grateful to be part of such a diverse and dynamic community of students and staff at NTU, and I look forward to seeing where this degree takes me.

                <br>
              I'm proud to say that I've recently completed The Credential of Readiness program from Harvard Business School Online. Throughout the program, I studied a range of important business concepts, including Business Analytics, Economics for Managers, and Financial Accounting.

I was able to apply what I learned to real-world scenarios, which gave me valuable experience in problem-solving and critical thinking. Overall, I feel that completing this program has given me a solid foundation in business and has prepared me well for the challenges of the modern workplace.
